### This is the configuration file for the hicAssembler algorithm
### IMPORTANT Notes about running the algorithm and config file arguments specifications
### 
### 1) Part1 of the pipeline must be run before Part2 and Parts1-2 must be run before Part3, and Parts1-3 must be run before Part4.
### 2) The algorithm can run each Part independentaly, or sequentially for any combination of Parts (As long as the required Parts were run beforehand).
### 3) Some of the arguments in this file are used in multiple Parts of the algorithm. These will be specified in subsequent comments
### 4) Any nuances about any particular argument will be explained in the argument descriptions sections
### 5) Lines in this configuration file that begin with a ### will NOT be read by the program, nor will empty lines be read
### 6) If an argument asks for a specific file, then a full file path must be provided to the file. Example /full/File/Path/To/Said/File/fileToUse
### 7) If an argument asks for a specific directory, then a full file path to the directory must be specified, 
###    AND the directory must exist before the algorithm is run. Also, the trailing slash of the directory must not be specified. Example /path/To/Directory/DirectoryToUse
### 8) An argument is specified with the following notation (do NOT deviate from this)... Example. ArgumentToBeSpecified = valueOfArgument
###    The argument is followed by a space then an equals sign then another space then the value of the argument
### 9) Finally, for any argument that specifies a plot/graph to be saved, an extension of the file type is required
###    .png is HIGHLY reccommended as a .pdf will drastically slow down the run time and be unopenable to any computer without a high amount of ram

### Part1 Specific Arguments and descriptions ###

### dendrogramOrderFile = fileName you wish to save the dendrogram ordering to from the UPGMA clustering. Will be saved to saveFilesDirectory/dendrogramOrderFile
### avgClusterPlot = fileName you wish to save the ContactMap Heat map plot to. Will be saved to saveFilesDirectory/avgClusterPlot. .png extension is reccomended
### avgClusterPlot_outlined = fileName you wish to save the ContactMap Heat map with the chromosomes outlined. Will be saved to saveFilesDirectory/avgClusterPlot. .png extension is reccomended
### binGroupFile = fileName you wish to save the clustering results to at the bin level. These are the resolution sized genomic loci produced by HiCPro.
### assessmentFile = fileName you wish to save the clustering assessment file to (the results from the scaffold assignment to a chromosome). Will be saved to saveFilesDirectory/assessmentFile
### minSize = 20 Default value. Minimum size a chromosome can be (resolution*minSize) as well as the number of consecutive non-start states from the HMM to denote a chromosome boundary
### modularity = .05 Default value. Percentage of the remaining data (after the HMM step is terminated) to use in the modularity maximization step. .05 corresponds to 5% of the data
### convergenceRounds = 8 Default value. Number of rounds the HMM is allowed to run to find convergence. Anything greater than 10 should NOT be used
### louvainRounds = 20 Default value. Number of rounds of the Louvain algorithm will be randomly initiated to help avoid local optima. Don't set this too high or it will run for a lonngggg time. 20 is already a bit high

### Part2 Specific Arguments and descriptions ###

# chromosomePlotSuffix = The suffix you want to add to the end of the title... Default will be Chr_1-NumberOfChromosomes chromosomePlotSuffix. Should be a string value
# chromosomePlotSuffix =  100Kb resolution (This is an example of this argument. Note the space at the very beggining to split up the Chr_number and the suffix
# fullGenomePlot = file name of the Plot for the full ordered/oriented genome plot. .png extension is HIGHLY reccomended
# fullGenomePlotTitle = Title you want for the full genome plot. Should be a string value. 
# plotOrderFile = fileName of the file that writes our the order of the binIDs for the Full genome heatMap
# nScaffolds = 6 default value. It is the number of scaffolds on any given chromosome to test all permutations for at the begginging of the algorithm. Maximum allowed is 8.
# scanScaffolds = 5 default value. The number of scaffolds within a sliding window to test all permutations for at the last step of the algoritm. Maxmimum allowed is nScaffolds value
# IMPORTANT NOTE - The nScaffolds and scanScaffolds arguments can dramatically alter the run time. nScaffolds=8,scanScaffolds=8 can result in a very long runtime if a chromosome is large (150Mb >)
# It is recommended to use a scanScaffolds value less than nScaffolds value by at least 1 or 2

### lengthCutoff = 500000 default value. The number in basepairs how far left and right to look for read pairs/restriction cut sites for adjacent scaffolds. Too far and the metric becomes useless. 500Kb seems to be a good happy medium
